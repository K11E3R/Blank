My awesome team (Ilyass, Yassine, Tommy, and Mathias) and I had the amazing opportunity to participate in the **NASA Space Apps Hackathon** in Paris! 🎉 We decided to tackle a super exciting and challenging project titled **"Seismic Detection Across the Solar System."** 🌌🌋

The goal of our project was to help scientists solve a big problem with seismic data collected from NASA’s detectors on **Mars** and the **Moon**. These detectors record continuous ground movement, but the signals are often mixed with a lot of noise. 😬 Before sending the data back to Earth, it needs to be filtered because noisy data requires a lot of energy to transmit. 🔋 So, we set out to filter the noise and send only the important data, making sure the communication uses less energy. 🌱✨

Our mission was to figure out when seismic events (like quakes!) happen by detecting the **start time** and **duration** of each event, even when the data was noisy. We analyzed how velocity changes over time (v = f(t)) and used this to identify the seismic events in a noisy graph. 📊📉

The best part? NASA shared open-source data from planetary signals, which we used to train a **machine learning (ML) model** to detect these seismic events more accurately. 💡🤖 We measured our model's accuracy using **Hoeffding’s Inequality**, making sure it could reliably pick out the important seismic info while filtering out the noise. 🧠✅
